## Sorting Players' Time in Assembly Language (8086)

This project is an assembly language program written for the 8086 architecture. It sorts players' time data entered by the user in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm. The program prompts the user to enter the number of players and their corresponding times, sorts the data, and then displays the sorted list.

### Program Structure

- **Initialization:** The program initializes necessary variables, including arrays to store player numbers (`PLAYERS`) and their times (`TIME`).

- **Input:** It prompts the user to enter the number of players and their respective times.

- **Selection Sort:** The program then sorts the players' times in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

- **Output:** Finally, it displays the sorted list of players along with their times.

### Files

- **0_com_template.txt:** Assembly language source code file. Contains the main program logic written in 8086 assembly language.

### How to Use

1. **Setup Environment:** Ensure you have an assembly language compiler or emulator installed that supports 8086 assembly language, such as Emu8086.

2. **Compile and Run:** Compile the assembly source code file using your assembler or emulator. Run the compiled executable to execute the program.

3. **Input Data:** Follow the prompts to input the number of players and their corresponding times.

4. **View Output:** Once the input is provided, the program will display the sorted list of players along with their times.
